# Video and Audio Content

Explain how the ability to use video and audio on the web has evolved since the early 2000s.
<br>
***The first influx of online videos and audio were made possible by proprietary plugin-based technologies like Flash and Silverlight. 
Both of these had security and accessibility issues, and are now obsolete, in favor of native HTML solutions (video) and (audio) elements and the availability of JavaScript APIs for controlling them. Now there are websites that help cut down on bandwith like Youtube.***

Describe the use of the (src) and (controls) attributes in the video element.

***Having fallback content inside the video element is helpful for users to watch video despite what browser they use.***
  
Write a very short story where (audio) and (video) are characters.
