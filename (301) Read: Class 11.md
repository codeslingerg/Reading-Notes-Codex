What does SQL stand for?

SQL stands for Structured Query Language.

What is a relational database?

A relational database is a type of database that stores and organizes data in a structured manner, using tables with rows and columns to represent and manage the data. It enforces relationships between different sets of data, allowing for efficient storage, retrieval, and manipulation of information.

What type of structure does a relational database work with?

A relational database works with a structured data model based on tables, where each table represents a specific entity or concept, and each row in the table represents an instance of that entity, while columns represent attributes or properties of that entity.

What is a ‘schema’?

A schema in the context of a relational database is a blueprint or logical design that defines the structure, organization, and relationships of the database objects such as tables, views, indexes, and constraints.

What is a NoSQL database?

NoSQL (short for "not only SQL") is a type of database that provides a flexible and schema-less approach to storing and retrieving data. Unlike traditional relational databases, NoSQL databases do not rely on a fixed schema and are designed to handle large volumes of unstructured or semi-structured data.

How does it work?

NoSQL databases use various data models (such as document, key-value, column-family, and graph) to store and retrieve data. Each model is optimized for specific use cases. For example, in a document-oriented NoSQL database like MongoDB, data is stored in flexible, JSON-like documents.

What is inside of a MongoDB database?

In a MongoDB database, you have collections, which are similar to tables in a relational database. Each collection contains documents, which are analogous to rows in a table. These documents store data in a hierarchical, JSON-like format, allowing for flexibility in the structure of the data.

Which is more flexible - SQL or MongoDB? and why.

MongoDB and other NoSQL databases are often considered more flexible than traditional SQL databases because they don't enforce a fixed schema. This means you can change the structure of your data without requiring extensive modifications to the database. However, this flexibility can also lead to potential challenges in maintaining data integrity and consistency.

What is the disadvantage of a NoSQL database?

One major disadvantage of NoSQL databases is that they may sacrifice some of the strong consistency and transactional capabilities provided by traditional relational databases. This can make it more challenging to ensure data integrity in scenarios where complex relationships and transactions are involved. Additionally, the lack of a fixed schema can lead to potential data quality issues if not managed carefully.
