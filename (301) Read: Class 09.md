What is functional programming?

Functional Programming is a a programming paradigm — a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs — that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data.


What is a pure function and how do we know if something is a pure function?

A pure function is a function that, given the same input, will always return the same output and does not have any observable side effect.


What are the benefits of a pure function?

The best benefits are that it returns the exact same value.


What is immutability?

The immutability is a state that cannot be changed after being created. 


What is Referential transparency?

Referential transparency occurs when a function consistently yields the same result for the same input.
