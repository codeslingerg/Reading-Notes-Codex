[What is OAuth](https://www.csoonline.com/article/562635/what-is-oauth-how-the-open-authorization-framework-works.html)

What is OAuth?

OAuth (Open Authorization) is an open standard protocol that allows secure authorization for accessing the resources of a user on one platform (the "resource owner") by another application (the "client"), without exposing the user's credentials to the client.

Give an example of what using OAuth would look like.

One example would be using authorization to log into a third party app with Google or Github. 

How does OAuth work? What are the steps that it takes to authenticate the user?

OAuth allows a user (resource owner) to grant a third-party application (client) limited access to their resources without exposing their credentials. 

What is OpenID?

OpenID allows a user to use their identity (authentication) across multiple websites without needing separate usernames and passwords.


[Authorization and Authentication flows](https://auth0.com/docs/get-started/authentication-and-authorization-flow)

What is the difference between authorization and authentication?

Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user, system, or entity while authorization, on the other hand, is the process of determining what actions a user or entity is allowed to perform after they have been authenticated.
