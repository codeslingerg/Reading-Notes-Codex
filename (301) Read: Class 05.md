#  [React Docs - Thinking in React](https://react.dev/learn/thinking-in-react)

What is the single responsibility principle and how does it apply to components?

***The single responsibility principle is the idea that a component should ideally do one thing***

What does it mean to build a ‘static’ version of your application?

***To build a static version means to build a version that renders the UI from your data model without adding any interactivity***

Once you have a static application, what do you need to add?

***You need to build components that reuse other components and pass data using 'props'***

What are the three questions you can ask to determine if something is state?

***Does it remain unchanged over time?***

***Is it passed in from a parent via props?***

***Can you compute it based on existing state or props in your component?***

How can you identify where state needs to live?

***By identifying where the closest comment parent component lives.***

#  [Higher-Order Functions](https://eloquentjavascript.net/05_higher_order.html#h_xxCc98lOBK)

What is a “higher-order function”?

***Functions that operate on other functions, either by taking them as arguments or by returning them***

Explore the greaterThan function as defined in the reading. In your own words, what is line 2 of this function doing?

***Line 2 is ensuring that greater than 10 will give the answer of 11 once it is rendered.***

Explain how either map or reduce operates, with regards to higher-order functions.

***Map operates in that it transforms an array by applying a function to all of its elements and building a new array from the returned values***
